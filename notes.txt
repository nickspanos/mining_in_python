First, you'll need to set up the server-side infrastructure for your mining pool. 
This will involve setting up a database to store information about the pool, such 
as the current block height, the pool's wallet address, and the addresses of all 
the miners that are connected to the pool. You'll also need to set up a server to 
handle communication with the miners and a backend to process the data that is mined.

Next, you'll need to design the server-side logic for your mining pool. This will 
involve implementing algorithms to distribute work to the miners, process the results 
that they return, and reward them for their efforts.

On the client side, you'll need to create a software that the miners can use to connect 
to the pool and start mining. This software will need to be able to communicate with the 
pool's server and request work, submit results, and receive rewards.

Finally, you'll need to test and debug your mining pool to ensure that it is working 
correctly. This will involve setting up test miners and mining on the pool to ensure 
that everything is functioning as expected.

I hope this helps get you started on your project! Let me know if you have any questions.
