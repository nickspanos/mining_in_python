# This code sets up a SQLite database called "mining_pool.db" and creates a table called "pool" with three columns: "block_height", "wallet_address", and "miner_address". It then inserts a row into the table with some initial data.

# Next, you'll need to write the server software to handle communication with the miners and a backend to process the data that is mined. This will involve creating a server that listens for incoming connections from miners and implements the logic to distribute work, process results, and reward miners.

# To create the software that the miners can use to connect to the pool and start mining, you'll need to create a client that can communicate with the pool's server using a network protocol like HTTP or WebSockets. The client will need to be able to request work from the server, submit results, and receive rewards.

# Finally, you'll need to implement the algorithms to distribute work, process results, and reward miners on the server side. This will likely involve creating a function to assign work to miners based on their current hashrate, a function to process the results that are returned, and a function to calculate and distribute rewards to the miners.
